TODO

- add bp_before_topic_posts and bp_after_topic_posts in topic.php request into trac
- add help text for subscribe/super subscribe - maybe a question mark roll over or tooltip help
- add back Email everyone in the group and clean up that code (maybe make an admin option to allow this? default to not allow.)
- fix the way admin and other settings are posted (no more mixed post/get)
- maybe create a way for users to GLOBALY set their preference for super/sub/unsub for the misc activity types
- maybe create global setting whether you want to hear about new group members joining
