TODO
- add ability for group admin to change default subscription settings. (announce groups should be subscribe)
  - if default is subscribed or supersub then let the user know when they join!
  
- add bp_before_topic_posts and bp_after_topic_posts in topic.php request into trac
- clean up the Email Options page so it's not yellow. make the 'you are subscribed' notice yellow. (maybe put the info back under Leave Group)

- maybe create a way for users to GLOBALY set their preference for super/sub/unsub for the misc activity types
- maybe create global setting whether you want to hear about new group members joining

- add help text for subscribe/super subscribe - maybe a question mark roll over or tooltip help

- add back Email everyone in the group and clean up that code (maybe make an admin option to allow this? default to not allow.)
